# Novus_Toolkit

The idea behind developing this application was to help users use functions like task manager, password manager, and note manager
and expense manager all at one place without downloading multiple apps for it.
So i developed this application through kotlin language using various toolkit and librarires like Jetpack Compose, Room Database
Library, etc.

The reason behind using local database was so that the user is able to use NOVUS in offline mode also.
Embedded features by keeping in mind the enhanced user experience:
1. Designed a simple yet effective UI(User Interface) so that each user can understand and use this app thoroughly.
2. Used biometric security using biometric manager library so that user's passwords are secured from others and in this way
only the user can access these passwords.
3. Designed the task, password and note manager into a list format so it is easy for user to comprehend the data.
4. Designed a custom pie chart using jetpack compose which uses data from database to map itself to represent the expenses
based upon category expenses.
5. Used feature that enables the app to work under dark & light theme.
